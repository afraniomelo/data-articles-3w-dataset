# Introduction

This is a [Git repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories) for developing [data articles](http://researchdata.springernature.com/posts/data-articles-what-are-they-and-how-can-they-benefit-me) (more than one!) about the [3W Dataset](https://github.com/petrobras/3W/tree/main/dataset), which is a part of the [3W Project](https://github.com/petrobras/3W), in an open and collaborative way with the global community.

The purpose of this work is to provide high-quality [data articles](http://researchdata.springernature.com/posts/data-articles-what-are-they-and-how-can-they-benefit-me) that facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the [3W Dataset](https://github.com/petrobras/3W/tree/main/dataset) and that can be used and referenced in commercial, academic and scientific projects supported by the [3W Dataset](https://github.com/petrobras/3W/tree/main/dataset).

# Current Version

The [DATA ARTICLE](2.0.0/DATA_ARTICLE.md) being developed relates to the [3W Dataset ***2.0.0***](https://github.com/petrobras/3W/tree/main/dataset). 

The 3W Dataset ***1.0.0*** is described in the article [***A realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells***](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106223) published in the ***Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering*** in mid-2019. 

Future versions of the [3W Dataset](https://github.com/petrobras/3W/tree/main/dataset) will require the development of other [data articles](http://researchdata.springernature.com/posts/data-articles-what-are-they-and-how-can-they-benefit-me).
