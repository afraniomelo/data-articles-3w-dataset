## The Data Article

### Title 

> ðŸ’¡ Titles may not exceed 110 characters, including whitespaces. They should avoid the use of acronyms, abbreviations, and unnecessary punctuation where possible. Colons and parentheses are not permitted.

3W Dataset 2.0.0: a realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells

_Note: the use of the acronym **3W** in the title is intentional and beneficial. Its meaning will be explained in the Background & Summary Section._

### Abstract

> ðŸ’¡ We recommend the Abstract should not exceed 170 words. It should not include references and should succinctly describe the data and how it may be used but should not make any claims regarding new scientific findings. We recommend URLs for download, or other details on dataset access, are not included. Please do not use sub-headings to break the Abstract into sections. 

In the oil industry, events in wells can cause economic damage, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Solutions based on Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning for early detection of events have shown promise for different industries. In 2019, after recognizing the importance and the lack of public datasets related to events in producing oil wells, Petrobras developed and made public the 3W Dataset first version, consisting of Multivariate Time Series labeled by experts corresponding to undesirable events or to periods of normal operation. Since then, the 3W Dataset has been explored and the published works already form a considerable scientific framework. Over the last few years, the 3W Dataset has also been evolved by Petrobras. For example, its structure was considerably modified, and more labeled data were incorporated. This data article describes the 3W Dataset current publicly available version and its publication will encourage and support the 3W Community to develop robust methodologies, digital products and services that can detect undesirable events early enough to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

### Background & Summary

### Corresponding Author

Correspondence to Ricardo Emanuel Vaz Vargas (ricardo.vargas@petrobras.com.br).

### Competing Interests

> ðŸ’¡ A 'Competing interests' statement is required for all papers accepted by and published in Scientific Data. If there is no conflict of interest, a statement declaring this must still be included in the manuscript (e.g. "The author(s) declare no competing interests").

The authors declare no competing interests.

### References

> ðŸ’¡ All references should be numbered sequentially, first throughout the text, then in tables, followed by figures and, finally, boxes; that is, references that only appear in tables, figures or boxes should be last in the reference list. Only one publication is given for each number. Only papers that have been published or accepted by a named publication or recognized preprint server should be in the numbered list; preprints of accepted papers in the reference list should be submitted with the manuscript.Grant details and acknowledgments are not permitted as numbered references. Footnotes are not used. Scientific Data suggests the use of the standard Nature referencing style. See examples [here](https://www.nature.com/sdata/publish/submission-guidelines#sec-4). In addition, we encourage the use of DOIs for all items that have them, as the easiest method for readers to find content. These may be appended to the end of any reference in URL format (https://doi.org/DOI, where DOI is the relevant number).
