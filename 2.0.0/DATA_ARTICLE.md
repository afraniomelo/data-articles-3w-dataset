## The Data Article

### Title ✅

> 💡 Titles may not exceed 110 characters, including whitespaces. They should avoid the use of acronyms, abbreviations, and unnecessary punctuation where possible. Colons and parentheses are not permitted.

3W Dataset 2.0.0: a realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells

_Note: the use of the acronym **3W** in the title is intentional and beneficial. Its meaning will be explained in the Background & Summary Section._

### Abstract ⁉️

> 💡 We recommend the Abstract should not exceed 170 words. It should not include references and should succinctly describe the data and how it may be used but should not make any claims regarding new scientific findings. We recommend URLs for download, or other details on dataset access, are not included. Please do not use sub-headings to break the Abstract into sections. 

In the oil industry, events in wells can cause economic damage, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Solutions based on Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning for early detection of events have shown promise for different industries. In 2019, after recognizing the importance and the lack of public datasets related to events in producing oil wells, Petrobras developed and made public the 3W Dataset first version, consisting of Multivariate Time Series labeled by experts corresponding to undesirable events or to periods of normal operation. Since then, the 3W Dataset has been explored and the published works already form a considerable scientific framework. Over the last few years, the 3W Dataset has also been evolved by Petrobras. For example, its structure was considerably modified, and more labeled data were incorporated. This data article describes the 3W Dataset current publicly available version and its publication will encourage and support the 3W Community to develop robust methodologies, digital products and services that can detect undesirable events early enough to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

### Background & Summary ⁉️

> 💡 This section should provide an overview of the study that generated the data, as well as outlining the potential reuse value of the data. Any previous publications that used these data, in whole or in part, should be cited and briefly summarized. Unlimited length.

_Note: the idea is that this section will be composed of the contents listed below, in the same order as the list is and with one paragraph per each item in this list. The references deemed necessary are also indicated. **Everyone is invited to contribute to this section. The completeness and cohesion of this section can be checked and its contents can be expanded/converted into paragraphs**._
