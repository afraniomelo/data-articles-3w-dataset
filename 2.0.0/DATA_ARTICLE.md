> 👍 Cohesion, clarity, and English grammar.

In the oil industry, events in wells can cause economic damage, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Solutions based on Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning for Early Detection of events have shown promise for different industries. In 2019, after recognizing the importance and the lack of public datasets related to events in producing oil wells, Petrobras developed and made public the 3W Dataset first version, consisting of Multivariate Time Series labeled by experts corresponding to undesirable events or to periods of normal operation. Since then, the 3W Dataset has been explored and the published works already form a considerable scientific framework. Over the last few years, the 3W Dataset has also been evolved by Petrobras. For example, its structure was considerably modified, and more labeled data were incorporated. This data article describes the 3W Dataset current publicly available version and its publication will encourage and support the 3W Community to develop robust methodologies, digital products and services that can detect undesirable events early enough to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

### Background & Summary ⁉️

> 💡 This section should provide an overview of the study that generated the data, as well as outlining the potential reuse value of the data. Any previous publications that used these data, in whole or in part, should be cited and briefly summarized. Unlimited length.

> 👍 Excellent references, lack of relevant content, cohesion, clarity, English grammar, and presentation format.

Undesirable events cause different types of damage to the oil industry, including economic, environmental accidents, and human casualties [[1 - Pending]](#1).

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based solutions have shown promise for Early Detection [[2 - Pending]](#2) of undesirable events in different industries [[3 - Pending]](#3). A requirement that is recognized as essential in this type of approach is the use of quality datasets [[4 - Pending]](#4).

In 2019, Petrobras recognized this need and then developed and published the first version of the 3W Dataset, which is described in detail by Vargas et al. [[5]](#5).

The 3W Dataset is a set of Multivariate Time Series (MTS) [[6 - Pending]](#6), also called instance, labeled by experts. The name 3W was chosen because this dataset is composed of instances from ***3*** different sources (real, simulated and hand-drawn) and which contain undesirable events that occur in oil ***W***ells. Each instance can contain 100% of the data relating to normality or part of the data relating to a single type of undesirable event. The basic idea is that temporal signatures between multiple variables of each type of event and normality can be learned (modeled) from a set of MTS.

The main features of the 3W Dataset are as follows. Its real instances correspond to the real industrial environment. Frozen variables, missing variables, outliers, etc. are not treated intentionally. The idea is to encourage and enable the development of methodologies and digital products capable of dealing with real adversities. Therefore, it has been advocated that the preservation of characteristics typical of the real industrial environment generates quality datasets. Simulated instances have been added because some types of undesirable events are rare in real life. Hand-drawn instances have been added because some rare events are complicated to simulate and experts are familiar with the behavior of the variables during these events.

As the 3W Dataset has been managed with Semantic Versioning [[7]](#7), its first version is identified by the code 1.0.0.

Since its publication, the 3W Dataset has been explored by several people who make up the 3W Community. These people are independent professionals and representatives of research institutions, startups, companies and oil operators from different countries.

Several works that have been developed and published has formed a considerable scientific framework related to Early Detection of undesirable events in oil wells. This framework is composed by books, conference papers, doctoral theses, final draduation projects, journal articles, master's degree dissertations, repository articles, and specialization monographs.

In 2022, Petrobras created the 3W Project as the first and only pilot of the Open Lab Module of the Connections Program for Innovation [[8]](#8). The purpose of this module is to encourage collaborative and open project developments on the Internet, more specifically on GitHub [[9]](#9). Since then, the 3W Dataset has been maintained and developed in its own corporate Git repository [[10]](#10) on GitHub.

In this same Git repository and as part of the 3W Project, there is also the 3W Toolkit, which is a software package written in Python 3 [add ref] whose purpose is to facilitate and encourage exploration of the 3W Dataset and proposals for comparative approaches.

In addition to these two main resources, 3W Dataset and 3W Toolkit, this Git repository [[10]](#10) also provides:

- Detailed description of the motivation, strategy, ambition, governance, and other aspects of the 3W Project;
- Lists with at least 100 published works that cite the 3W Dataset;
- Specification of priority problems (benchmarks);
- The 3W Project contributing guide;
- Information about the 3W Community;
- 3W Dataset overviews developed by the 3W Community;
- The 3W Community code of conduct;
- Release notes for the published versions of the 3W Dataset.

Since 2022, the 3W Dataset has also been evolved by Petrobras and its current publicly available version is identified by the code 2.0.0.

This data article details the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 and summarizes the advances incorporated into this version since version 1.0.0. The content of this data article will support the 3W Community to develop robust methodologies, digital products and services that can detect undesirable events in oil wells early enough to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

### Methods ⁉️

> 💡 The Methods section in Data Descriptors should describe any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition and any computational processing. Unlimited length.

_Note: the idea is that this section will be composed of the subsections and contents listed below, in the same order as the subsections and **expandable** lists are and with one paragraph per each item in these lists. The references deemed necessary are also indicated. **Everyone is invited to contribute to this section. The completeness and cohesion of this section can be checked and its contents can be expanded/converted into paragraphs**._

In a nutshell, the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is made up of 3 types of instances and was generated with 3 methods, one per type of instance. These methods are described in this section based on the mathematical definition of MTS presented in the following subsection. Based on this definition and to support both the 3W Project and this article, a nomenclature was developed and is detailed in the subsequent subsection. The types of instances and the methods associated with them are described in their own subsections. Certain characteristics are common to all 3 methods and are therefore detailed in a separate subsection.

#### Mathematical Definition of Multivariate Time Series

The chosen definition for MTS is the same as that used in the article that published the 3W Dataset 1.0.0 [[5]](#5). This definition is reproduced below.

A dataset ***DS*** is a set of _m_ MTS (S<sup>_i_</sup> | _i_ = {1, 2, …, _m_}, ∀ _m_ ∈ Z, and _m_ > 1) and is defined as ***DS*** = {***S***<sup>1</sup>, ***S***<sup>2</sup>, …, ***S***<sup>_m_</sup>}. Each MTS _i_ is an instance that is composed of a set of _n_ univariate time series (x<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_j_</sub> | _j_ = {1, 2, …, _n_}, ∀ _n_ ∈ Z, and _n_ > 1) (also referenced as process variable or just variable), and is defined as ***S***<sup>_i_</sup> = {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2</sub>, …, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_</sub>}. Each variable _j_ that composes an MTS _i_ is an ordered temporal sequence of _p_<sub>_i_</sub> observations taken at the time _t_ (_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_j,t_</sub> | _t_ = {1, 2, …, _p_<sub>_i_</sub>}, ∀ _p_<sub>_i_</sub> ∈ Z, and _p_<sub>_i_</sub> > 1). Therefore, each MTS _i_ is viewed in this work as a matrix defined as S<sup>_i_</sup> = {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,1</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,1</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,1</sub>; _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,2</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,2</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,2</sub>; _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>}.

Note that all instances have a fixed number of variables _n_, but each instance can be composed of any quantity of observations _p_<sub>_i_</sub>. It is also important to note that all variables of an instance _i_ have fixed number
of observations _p_<sub>_i_</sub>.

#### The Developed Nomenclature

The terms that make up the nomenclature used in this work are derived from the definition of MTS presented in the previous section. These terms are shown in Table 1.

### References 🚧

> 💡 All references should be numbered sequentially, first throughout the text, then in tables, followed by figures and, finally, boxes; that is, references that only appear in tables, figures or boxes should be last in the reference list. Only one publication is given for each number. Only papers that have been published or accepted by a named publication or recognized preprint server should be in the numbered list; preprints of accepted papers in the reference list should be submitted with the manuscript.Grant details and acknowledgments are not permitted as numbered references. Footnotes are not used. Scientific Data suggests the use of the standard Nature referencing style. See examples [here](https://www.nature.com/sdata/publish/submission-guidelines#sec-4). In addition, we encourage the use of DOIs for all items that have them, as the easiest method for readers to find content. These may be appended to the end of any reference in URL format (https://doi.org/DOI, where DOI is the relevant number).
