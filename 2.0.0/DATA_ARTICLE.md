In the oil industry, events in wells can cause economic damage, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Solutions based on Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning for Early Detection of events have shown promise for different industries. In 2019, after recognizing the importance and the lack of public datasets related to events in producing oil wells, Petrobras developed and made public the 3W Dataset first version, consisting of Multivariate Time Series labeled by experts corresponding to undesirable events or to periods of normal operation. Since then, the 3W Dataset has been explored and the published works already form a considerable scientific framework. Over the last few years, the 3W Dataset has also been evolved by Petrobras. For example, its structure was considerably modified, and more labeled data were incorporated. This data article describes the 3W Dataset current publicly available version and its publication will encourage and support the 3W Community to develop robust methodologies, digital products and services that can detect undesirable events early enough to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

### Background & Summary ⁉️

Oil remains a cornerstone of contemporary society, serving as a fundamental resource for global economic development and industrial activity. It is indispensable across a broad range of sectors, including transportation, manufacturing, energy production, and petrochemicals, making it a critical driver of modern life [[24]](#24). The increasing demands associated with population growth, urbanization, and technological progress have caused a continuous increase in global oil production, further demonstrating its critical role in the competitiveness of industrialized economies [[25]](#25). Beyond its economic contributions, the oil industry also supports vital social infrastructure and national development strategies, thus exerting a large influence on both macroeconomic stability and social functions [[26]](#26).

Despite the increasing global efforts surrounding the energy transition, driven by the proliferation of renewable energy technologies, electrification trends, and efforts to mitigate climate change, it is expected that humanity's dependence on oil will persist in the medium to long term [[27]](#27). This continued dependence is especially pronounced in sectors that are not easily electrified, such as aviation, maritime transport, and heavy-duty freight, as well as in the petrochemical industry, which relies heavily on oil as a feedstock for the production of plastics and other synthetic materials. Furthermore, the infrastructural and economic inertia embedded in the global energy system presents substantial challenges to the rapid substitution of oil. As such, any energy strategy must account for the relevance of oil within a diversifying, but still hydrocarbon-dependent, global framework.

Given that a completely oil-free energy sector remains an unrealistic expectation in the foreseeable future, both industry and academia must prioritize the development and implementation of technologies that minimize the environmental impact and carbon footprint associated with oil extraction, processing, and consumption. Rather than focusing exclusively on displacement strategies, there is an urgent need to innovate within existing fossil fuel systems to improve efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote cleaner production pathways [[28](#28), [29](#29)].

 > Undesirable events cause different types of damage to the oil industry, including economic, environmental accidents, and human casualties [[1 - Pending]](#1).

The effective management of undesirable events is a critical component in reducing the carbon footprint and overall environmental impact of the oil and gas industry. Besides ecological and environmental damages, undesirable events cause different types of strains to the sector, including financial losses and human casualties [[30]](#30).
These events, which may include well blowouts, equipment failures, pipeline ruptures, and unplanned emissions, not only disrupt operations but also compromise safety and environmental integrity, demonstrating the need for preventive measures [[31]](#31). As the industry evolves toward cleaner practices, preventing these incidents becomes even more essential to maintaining public trust and regulatory compliance while minimizing emissions and environmental hazards. This necessity has driven industry professionals and academic scholars to develop forecasting techniques and predictive models capable of anticipating such events and allowing interventions that prevent disasters and reduce the frequency and cost of reactive maintenance [[32]](#32). 

Abnormal Event Management (AEM) refers to the systematic detection, diagnosis, and mitigation of unexpected or irregular events within complex industrial systems [[33]](#33). In the oil and gas industry, where operational safety, environmental protection, and economic performance are tightly coupled, AEM plays a crucial role in minimizing the impact of failures. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into AEM has significantly enhanced the ability of the industry to identify, predict, and respond to anomalies. By analyzing vast streams of operational data, such as pressure, temperature, vibration, and flow rates, algorithms can uncover subtle patterns that precede abnormal conditions, allowing early intervention and preventive maintenance strategies [[34]](#34).

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based solutions have shown promise for Early Detection [[2 - Pending]](#2) of undesirable events in different industries [[3 - Pending]](#3). A requirement that is recognized as essential in this type of approach is the use of quality datasets [[4 - Pending]](#4).

Machine learning models, including supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning approaches, have shown considerable promise in detecting anomalies related to equipment malfunctions, leaks, sensor failures, or safety hazards [[35]](#35). These models not only improve the speed and accuracy of anomaly detection but also reduce the reliance on manually defined thresholds and expert-crafted rules, making them adaptable to a wide range of operating conditions. Real-time AEM systems powered by machine learning can support continuous asset monitoring, reduce unplanned downtime, improve safety compliance, and optimize resource utilization [[36]](#36). In addition, such systems can be instrumental in minimizing environmental risks by detecting deviations that can indicate potential emissions or leaks before they escalate. Moreover, AI-enhanced AEM frameworks can improve decision making by providing real-time alerts and predictive diagnostics, allowing operators to act quickly and effectively [[37]](#37). Ultimately, the deployment of AI-driven abnormal event management solutions contributes to safer, more efficient, and environmentally responsible operations in the oil and gas industry, reinforcing its resilience amid growing complexity.

A critical requirement for the successful implementation of AI-driven abnormal event management systems is the availability of high-quality data sets [[38]](#38). The effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting and predicting anomalies is directly dependent on the accuracy, completeness, and representativeness of the training data. Poor data quality, such as missing values, noise, labeling errors, or lack of variability, can significantly reduce model performance, leading to false alarms or missed detections [[39]](#39). 

In 2019, Petrobras recognized this need and then developed and published the first version of the 3W Dataset, which is described in detail by Vargas et al. [[5]](#5).

The 3W Dataset is a set of Multivariate Time Series (MTS) [[6 - Pending]](#6), also called instances, labeled by experts. The name 3W was chosen because this dataset is composed of instances from ***3*** different sources (real, simulated and hand-drawn) and which contain undesirable events that occur in oil ***W***ells. Each instance can contain 100% of the data relating to normality or part of the data relating to a single type of undesirable event. The basic idea is that temporal signatures between multiple variables of each type of event and normality can be learned (modeled) from a set of MTS.

The main features of the 3W Dataset are as follows. Its real instances correspond to the real industrial environment. Frozen variables, missing variables, outliers, etc. are not treated intentionally. The idea is to encourage and enable the development of methodologies and digital products capable of dealing with real adversities. Therefore, it has been advocated that the preservation of characteristics typical of the real industrial environment generates quality datasets. Simulated instances have been added because some types of undesirable events are rare in real life. Hand-drawn instances have been added because some rare events are complicated to simulate and experts are familiar with the behavior of the variables during these events.

As the 3W Dataset has been managed with Semantic Versioning [[7]](#7), its first version is identified by the code 1.0.0.

Since its publication, the 3W Dataset has been explored by several people who make up the 3W Community. These people are independent professionals and representatives of research institutions, startups, companies and oil operators from different countries.

Several works that have been developed and published have formed a considerable scientific framework related to Early Detection of undesirable events in oil wells. This framework is composed of books, conference papers, doctoral theses, final graduation projects, journal articles, master's degree dissertations, repository articles, and specialization monographs. The list of academic publications, which is known by the authors, that either use or cite the 3W dataset is compiled in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/petrobras/3W/blob/main/LISTS_OF_CITATIONS.md), and its yearly progression is plotted in Fig. XX.

Figure XX - Number of different types of publications over the years that cite or use the 3W dataset for the development of models. 

The success of the 3W dataset in fostering the development of AI models for AEM in oil and gas wells is evident in Fig. XX. As a real, comprehensive, and well-structured multivariate time series dataset, 3W has become a valuable benchmark for testing and validating machine learning algorithms aimed at anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and event classification in complex well operations. Over the years, its adoption by researchers worldwide has steadily increased, highlighting its relevance, accessibility, and practical applicability in advancing intelligent monitoring systems. This growing academic engagement reflects not only the dataset's quality but also its pivotal role in accelerating innovation in the digitalization of the oil and gas sector.

In 2022, Petrobras created the 3W Project as the first and only pilot of the Open Lab Module of the Connections Program for Innovation [[8]](#8). The purpose of this module is to encourage collaborative and open project development on the Internet, more specifically on GitHub [[9]](#9). Since then, the 3W Dataset has been maintained and developed in its own corporate Git repository [[10]](#10) on GitHub.

In this same Git repository and as part of the 3W Project, there is also the 3W Toolkit, which is a software package written in Python 3 [[11]](#11) whose purpose is to facilitate and encourage exploration of the 3W Dataset and proposals for comparative approaches.

In addition to these two main resources, 3W Dataset and 3W Toolkit, this Git repository [[10]](#10) also provides:

- Detailed description of the motivation, strategy, ambition, governance, and other aspects of the 3W Project;
- Lists with at least 100 published works that cite the 3W Dataset;
- Specification of priority problems (benchmarks);
- The 3W Project contributing guide;
- Information about the 3W Community;
- 3W Dataset overviews developed by the 3W Community;
- The 3W Community code of conduct;
- Release notes for the published versions of the 3W Dataset.

Since 2022, the 3W Dataset has also evolved by Petrobras, and its current publicly available version is identified by the code 2.0.0.

This data article details the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 and summarizes the advances incorporated into this version since version 1.0.0. The content of this data article will support the 3W Community to develop robust methodologies, digital products and services that can detect undesirable events in oil wells early enough to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

### Methods ⁉️

> 💡 The Methods section in Data Descriptors should describe any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition and any computational processing. Unlimited length.

In a nutshell, the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is made up of three types of instances and was generated with three methods, one per type of instance. These methods are described in this section and are based on the mathematical definition of MTS presented in the following subsection. According to this definition and to support both the 3W Project and this article, a nomenclature was developed and is detailed in the subsequent subsection. The types of instances and the methods associated with them are described in their own subsections. Certain characteristics are common to all three methods and are therefore detailed in a separate subsection.

#### Mathematical Definition of Multivariate Time Series

The chosen definition for MTS is the same as that used in the article that published the 3W Dataset 1.0.0 [[5]](#5). This definition is reproduced below.

A dataset ***DS*** is a set of _m_ MTS (S<sup>_i_</sup> | _i_ = {1, 2, …, _m_}, ∀ _m_ ∈ Z, and _m_ > 1) and is defined as ***DS*** = {***S***<sup>1</sup>, ***S***<sup>2</sup>, …, ***S***<sup>_m_</sup>}. Each MTS _i_ is an instance that is composed of a set of _n_ univariate time series (x<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_j_</sub> | _j_ = {1, 2, …, _n_}, ∀ _n_ ∈ Z, and _n_ > 1) (also referenced as process variable or just variable), and is defined as ***S***<sup>_i_</sup> = {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2</sub>, …, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_</sub>}. Each variable _j_ that composes an MTS _i_ is an ordered temporal sequence of _p_<sub>_i_</sub> observations taken at the time _t_ (_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_j,t_</sub> | _t_ = {1, 2, …, _p_<sub>_i_</sub>}, ∀ _p_<sub>_i_</sub> ∈ Z, and _p_<sub>_i_</sub> > 1). Therefore, each MTS _i_ is viewed in this work as a matrix defined as S<sup>_i_</sup> = {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,1</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,1</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,1</sub>; _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,2</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,2</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,2</sub>; _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,_p_<sub>_i_</sub></sub>}.

Note that all instances have a fixed number of variables _n_, but each instance can be composed of any quantity of observations _p_<sub>_i_</sub>. It is also important to note that all variables of an instance _i_ have a fixed number
of observations _p_<sub>_i_</sub>.

#### The Developed Nomenclature

The terms that make up the nomenclature used in this work are derived from the definition of MTS presented in the previous section. These terms are shown in Table 1.

**Table 1**<br>Terms that make up the nomenclature used in this work.
| **Term** | **Meaning** |
| -------- | ------- |
| Variable | Physical quantity at a specific point in the production system of a specific well from which values are acquired to generate a univariable time series _j_: _x_<sub>_j_</sub> |
| Timestamp | Instant _t_ (date + time) at which values are acquired or generated and then associated with variables: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| Observation | Vector with values from _n_ variables of a single instance _i_ acquired at a timestamp _t_: {_x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>1,t</sub>, _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>2,t</sub>, ..., _x_<sup>_i_</sup><sub>_n_,t</sub>} |
| Label | Marking determined by an expert regarding the well condition in terms of a particular property. The labeling process is explained in Subsection [Common Characteristics Among the Methods](#common-characteristics-among-the-methods) |
| Class label | Marking determined by an expert regarding the well condition in terms of the occurrence of an undesirable event or normality. See additional explanation in Subsection [Common Characteristics Among the Methods](#common-characteristics-among-the-methods) |
| State label | Marking determined by an expert regarding the well condition in operational terms. See additional explanation in Subsection [Common Characteristics Among the Methods](#common-characteristics-among-the-methods) |
| Sample | Part of an MTS, including all _n_ variables and all observations between two timestamps |
| Period | A sample that respects the following two conditions: all its observations are labeled with the same class label and it is not contained in another temporally larger sample with all observations labeled with the same class label. In other words, a period is the largest possible sample whose observations are labeled with the same class label |
| Instance | Collection of temporally sequential periods associated with a specific well |
| Type of event | Operational states in which a well can find itself, including normality, failures and undesired states |
| Dataset | Set of instances with multiple types of events |

#### Types of Instances

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is made up of three types of instances, called real, simulated and hand-drawn.

Each of these types of instances has been fundamentally defined according to the origin of its data. Data from real instances were obtained from different Petrobras Plant Information Management Systems (PIMS) [[12 - Pending]](#12), more precisely, different AVEVA PI System [[13]](#13) environments. Data from simulated instances were generated with OLGA [[14]](#14), a dynamic multiphase flow simulator adopted by several oil companies around the globe. And data from hand-drawn instances was literally drawn by experts and extracted with a digital tool developed exclusively for this purpose.

Each type of instance, and therefore each data source, required the development of its own method for acquiring and labeling data. The common characteristics among the three developed methods are described in the following subsection. The particularities of each method are detailed in the subsequent subsections.

#### Common Characteristics Among the Methods

All instances, regardless of their type, are related to satellite-type offshore producing wells without a manifold [[15 - Pending]](#15). This type of well can be operated with different lifting methods [[16 - Pending]](#16) interspersed over time, sometimes with the natural method and sometimes with an artificial lifting method. The natural method can only be used when the reservoir pressure is sufficient to produce hydrocarbons at a commercial rate without requiring any additional energy. Otherwise, some artificial lifting method is required precisely so that extra energy can be added to the system.

Fig. 1 contains a diagram representing the considered scenario when designing the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. This diagram only covers the components necessary for a good understanding of how the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 was conceived. In summary, this diagram shows the production platform, the well itself, the subsea Christmas tree [[17 - Pending]](#17), the production and service lines, as well as sensors and valves.

  </tr>
</table>

There are 27 variables present in all instances of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. According to the used definition of MTS, even if data has not been obtained or generated for a certain variable in a certain instance, that variable is part of that instance. The name of each of these variables, what it represents and its physical position in the considered scenario (see Fig. 1) are shown in Table 2.

**Table 2**<br>Details of the variables in the 3W Dataset 2.0.0.
| **Name** | **Description** | **Position** |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |

| T-MON-CKP | Upstream temperature of the PCK | ?Position - Pending? |
| T-PDG | Temperature at the PDG | ?Position - Pending? |
| T-TPT | Temperature at the TPT | ?Position - Pending? |

All instances were generated with observations taken every 1 second. In other words, the sampling frequency in all instances is fixed at 1 Hz.

All the variables associated with each physical quantity (type of variable) are represented with the same measurement unit according to Table 3.

**Table 3**<br>Physical quantities and their measurement units.
| **Physical Quantity** | **Measurement Unit** |
| -------- | ------- |
| Choke opening | % |
| Flow rate | m3/s | 
| Pressure | Pa |
| Temperature | oC |
| Valve state | Adimensional: 0 for closed, 1 for open, and 0.5 for any other state |

The labeling process applied to all instances of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 resulted in two types of labels, called class labels and state labels. The class labels are directly related to normality or to some undesirable event. The state labels are directly related to the operational status of the well in question. 

The numerical codes associated with the class labels are detailed in Table 4. Any of these codes can be associated with any observation from any instance. Codes 101 to 109 represent transient conditions between normality and steady states referring to undesirable events. It is important to note that not all undesirable events have transient conditions associated with them. When the well condition in terms of the occurrence of an undesirable event or normality is unknown at any time, the associated observation is labeled with the class label Unknown (code = NaN = Not a Number). Each instance as a whole is associated with the only steady state code (1 to 9) to which at least part of its observations have been associated. This code is referenced as the type of event.

**Table 4**<br>Class labels and their numerical codes.

#### Method Relating to Real Instances

The particularities of the method developed for real data are listed below.

* Regarding data acquisition:
    1. From records in Petrobras' PIMS [[12 - Pending]](#12), more precisely different AVEVA PI System [[13]](#13) environments;
    1. With linear interpolation provided by the AVEVA PI System;
    1. No treatments for frozen variables or missing values;
    1. With conversion to standard measurement units.
* Regarding labeling:
    1. By experts using a Petrobras' web system developed exclusively for labeling and exporting real data to the 3W Dataset.

The main limitations of this method are:

1. Coverage of only events that took place in real life and had archived records;
1. Contextualizations (mappings between variables and tags in PIMS) were not verified;
1. Original measurement units (before conversions) were not verified.

#### Method Relating to Simulated Instances

The particularities of the method developed for simulated data are listed below.

* Regarding data generation:
    1. By planning a matrix of simulations with OLGA [[14]](#14), gradually varying the main parameters of the considered scenario;
    1. Running simulations and filtering out those whose results did not converge (well did not produce normally);
    1. Automated extraction of time series from TPL files generated by OLGA and relating to successful simulations;
    1. With perfectly periodic time series;
    1. No frozen variables or missing values;
    1. With variables already represented with standardized measurement units;
    1. Without any noise in the time series.
* Regarding labeling:
    1. Fully automated from simulation results.

The main limitations of this method are:

1. Use of a single model associated with a single well;
1. Use of a simplified simulation strategy. Example: hydrates were simulated using a valve with a linear closing percentage.

#### Method Relating to Hand-Drawn Instances

The particularities of the method developed for hand-drawn data are listed below.

* Regarding data generation:
    1. Proprietary tool based on image processing developed exclusively for generating hand-drawn data for the 3W Dataset;
    1. Each variable is hand-drawn on its own chart by an expert. An example is shown in Fig. 2;
    1. Automated digitization of time series via scanning graphs printed on paper.
* Regarding labeling:
    1. From expert markings on the graphs printed on paper.

The main limitations of this method are:

1. Coverage of only the well-known signatures of undesirable events;
1. Expert bias when drawing and labeling time series;
1. Expert manual dexterity.

#### 3W Dataset 2.0.0 Structure

In the root of the directory containing the dataset there is a file called dataset.ini, which specifies properties of the 3W Dataset 2.0.0. The proposal is that all users concentrate their searches for these properties in this file.

The data itself in the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 is organized in subdirectories dedicated to each type of event. The name of each directory is the numerical code associated with each type of event (see Table 4).

Each instance is persisted in its own Apache Parquet file [[19]](#19), or simply Parquet file, an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides high-performance compression and encoding schemes to handle complex data in bulk and is supported in many programming languages and analytics tools.

The logic used to formulate file names depends on the type of instance.

The name of each real instance is composed as follows: WELL-[incremental id]_[timestamp of oldest observation].parquet. Example: WELL-00014_20170917140000.parquet. Each real well is associated with a unique id, regardless of the type of event (subdirectory).

The name of each simulated instance is composed as follows: SIMULATED_[incremental id].parquet. Example: SIMULATED_00072.parquet. The incremental id is initialized from 1 for each type of event (subdirectory).

The name of each hand-drawn instance is composed as follows: DRAWN_[incremental id].parquet. Example: DRAWN_00007.parquet. The incremental id is initialized from 1 for each type of event (subdirectory).

All Parquet files are created with Pyarrow engine [[20]](#20) and Brotli compression [[21]](#21). These choices were made based on a good compromise between compression ratio and reading time.

The timestamps vector of each instance is used as the index in the corresponding Parquet file. All timestamps are represented in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.

All variables and labels are stored in columns of Parquet files, variables as float and labels as Int64 (not int64).

### Technical Validation ⁉️

> 💡 This section should present any experiments or analyses that are needed to support the technical quality of the dataset. This section may be supported by figures and tables, as needed. Unlimited length.

> 👍 Lack of relevant content, cohesion, clarity, English grammar, and presentation format.

Several features that have been carefully incorporated into the methods described in the Methods Section ensure that the 3W Dataset 2.0.0 has high technical quality. The main ones are as follows:

* In the real instances: maintenance of real data characteristics, labeling by experts, and validation by an expert committee;
* In the simulated instances: simulation models calibrated by experts, and systematized labeling;
* In the hand-drawn instances: hand-drawn graphs by experts, and systematized labeling.

The quantity and the diversity of the works developed and published by the 3W Community show the relevance and the technical quality of the 3W Dataset. This scientific framework is made up of dozens of published works, including books, conference papers, doctoral theses, final graduation projects, journal articles, master's degree dissertations, and specialization monographs. More information on these works can be found in the 3W Project repository [[10]](#10).

### Usage Notes ⁉️

> 💡 'Usage Notes' is an optional section that can be used to provide information that may assist other researchers who reuse your data. Most commonly these are additional technical notes about how to access or process the data. Please do not use this section to write a conclusions section, or similar, as we do not publish these. Unlimited length.

This data article describes the 3W Dataset 2.0.0, the current publicly available version, and details its evolution with respect to version 1.0.0, which is detailed by Vargas et al. [[5]](#5).

The 3W Dataset 2.0.0 was generated with code written in Python 3.10 [[11]](#11) and the main used resources were from the Pandas 1.5 [[22]](#22) and Pyarrow 19.0 [[20]](#20) packages. 

The 3W Dataset 2.0.0 was designed to be explored with basically any programming language (not just Python). Regardless of the language used, the Parquet files [[19]](#19) must be read with the Pyarrow method and the Brotli compression [[21]](#21).

When comparing results obtained in different works, it is important to note which versions of the 3W Dataset were used. Certain comparisons can be complex due to the significant differences between the versions of the 3W Dataset published so far. The main changes incorporated in version 2.0.0 compared to version 1.0.0 are as follows:

1. Its structure was considerably modified. Data is now saved in Parquet files, and no longer in CSV files; 
1. 1 variable was discontinued (T-JUS-CKGL) and 20 others were added, resulting in 27 variables in the current version;
1. 1 undesirable type of event has been added: Hydrate in Service Line;
1. The number of real instances increased by 94;
1. The number of simulated instances increased by 150;
1. The number of actual wells covered rose from 21 to 42;
1. More labeled data (observations) were incorporated.

More details can be found in the release notes available in the 3W Project repository [[10]](#10).

### Code Availability ⁉️

> 💡 For all publications, a statement must be included under the subheading "Code Availability" indicating whether and how and custom code can be accessed, including any restrictions to access. This section can also include information on the versions of any software used, if relevant, and any specific variables or parameters used to generate, test, or process the current dataset if these are not included in the Methods. Please see our policy on code availability for more information. The code availability statement should be placed at the end of the manuscript, immediately before the references. If no custom code has been used then the statement is still required in order to state this. 

> 👍 Lack of relevant content, cohesion, clarity, English grammar, and presentation format.

The 3W Project also develops and makes publicly available in its Git repository [[10]](#10) the 3W Toolkit, which is a software package written in Python 3 [[11]](#11) and licensed under Apache 2.0 [[23]](#23). Its purpose is to facilitate and encourage exploration of the 3W Dataset and proposals for comparative approaches. It provides a range of features for loading data, visualizing time series, calculating metrics, etc.

Python practitioners can therefore use and adapt the 3W Toolkit to speed up their analysis with the 3W Dataset 2.0.0.

An in-depth description of the 3W Toolkit is beyond the scope of this data article, but its documentation and examples of use can be found in the 3W Project repository [[10]](#10).
